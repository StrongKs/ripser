/*
 Explanation of Key Steps:
 
 1. Include Necessary Libraries:
 - We include `Rcpp.h` to interact between C++ and R.
 - Other standard C++ libraries are included for file handling, strings, and storing collections of data.
 
 2. Function Definition with Rcpp Export:
 - `computePersistenceBarcodesR` is exported using `[[Rcpp::export]]` so it can be called from R.
 - It takes a filename, `dim_max`, `threshold`, and `ratio` as inputs—similar to the original Ripser command line tool.
 
 3. File Handling:
 - We use `std::ifstream` to open the input file.
 - If the file can't be opened, `Rcpp::stop` will throw an error in R to inform the user.
 
 4. Data Reading:
 - We read distance values from the file.
 - This part is just a placeholder right now—Ripser can handle multiple formats, so this logic will need to be expanded.
 
 5. Persistence Computation:
 - This step is just a placeholder. We'll need to bring in the actual Ripser code to compute persistence pairs.
 
 6. Returning the Results:
 - We return an `Rcpp::List`, which is an easy way to pass structured data back to R.
 - Using `Named` labels helps make the output more readable for R users.
